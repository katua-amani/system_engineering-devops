Brief Introduction About Myself
My name is Amani Katua. I am from Kajiado, Kenya. I am the first born of three, currently pursuing Alx Pathway Foundations, and on to university at Strathmore University next year.
I hope to be financially free at 23 years old. able to pay all my bills and still have money left over. I am interested in businesses, which is what I'll be studying in university... hoping to one day help African business scale up and onto the global stage.
